The purpose of this assignment is to create two scripts (in R and Python), use language-specific libraries, read a dataset into the code, plot it, and make a linear regression line.

## Tools/libraries used
#Python libraries
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

# R libraries
ggplot2

## Notes on results
Both the Python and R scripts gave an R^2 value of 0.7852. The R script was able to give more details, including the adjusted R^2 value (0.7583), the F statistic (29.24) and the P-value (0.0006407).
